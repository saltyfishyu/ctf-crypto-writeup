We get 3 prime numbers. This is still fine, this could simply be multiprime RSA
```
ciphertext = plaintext^e mod n = (plaintext^e')^3 mod n
```
```
ciphertext = plaintext^3 mod n
```
then we do these things.

#python pt.py

we get these things(Chinese Reminder Theorem)
```
pt^3 mod p = ciperhtext mod p = 20827907988103030784078915883129
```
```
pt^3 mod q = ciperhtext mod q = 19342563376936634263836075415482
```
```
pt^3 mod r = ciperhtext mod r = 10525283947807760227880406671000
```
we figured that wolframalpha had this implemented
